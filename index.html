    <h1>The PS5 looks like the roman number V</h1>

        I can't beleive nowone is talking about how the PS5's front is designed to resemble the roman numeral 5.
        This was the first thing that I noticed when I was watching the reveal live and I felt it was a neat
        touch on their part to use the 5 in PS5 into the design.

        As I was going through various articles and youtube video covering the release, I was surprised to see that
        none of them had mentioned this <a href="https://www.google.com">reference</a>. So, now here I am, decided to make a post just for this purpose.
